# Docker FVS
This repository includes code to build versions of the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) from source inside Docker containers using the Ubuntu OS to enable reproducible use of FVS in other forest modeling applications.

The test suite is currently limited to ensuring all regional variants of FVS within the United States can process a simple keyfile without producing warnings or errors.
